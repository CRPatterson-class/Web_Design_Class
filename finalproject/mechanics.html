        <h1>Farming</h1>
            <img src="/Final_Project1/images/Farming1.jpg" alt="Farmmech">
        <p>Farming is the foundation of <i>Fields of Mistria</i>, anchoring your daily routine and long-term progress. You’ll begin with simple tools and small plots, planting seeds and learning which crops thrive in each season. Over time, your efforts expand into raising animals, upgrading equipment, and unlocking new varieties of plants that can only grow under specific conditions. Careful management of time and resources ensures your farm not only supports your character but also contributes to the town’s revival. Seasonal changes add variety, as each brings unique challenges, weather patterns, and festivals to prepare for. Farming is never static — it grows with you, blending strategy, creativity, and a rewarding sense of accomplishment.</p>

        <h1>Exploring</h1>
            <img src="/Final_Project1/images/Exploring.png" alt="Exploremech">
        <p>Exploration in <i>Fields of Mistria</i> balances freedom with gradual progression, encouraging players to push beyond the village and uncover the world’s secrets. Forests, coastlines, ruins, and hidden trails all hold resources and stories that bring variety to each adventure. Some discoveries happen naturally, while others require patience, upgraded tools, or bravery to reach. Exploration is more than travel — it’s about rewarding curiosity and tying discovery into the growth of your character and the town.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Caving:</b> The caves descend through multiple levels, each one tougher and richer in rewards. Some areas feature elemental themes like fire, ice, or shadow, offering unique resources and challenges for the prepared explorer. </li>
                <li><b>Map Unlockables:</b> Parts of the map remain blocked until you earn better tools or complete quests. Bridges, ruins, and paths gradually open, and since the game is in Early Access, more areas will continue to be added in future updates.</li>

        <h1>Treasure Hunting</h1>
            <img src="/Final_Project1/images/TreasureHunting1.jpg" alt="treasurehunting">
        <p>Treasure hunting brings mystery and anticipation to your adventures in <i>Fields of Mistria</i>. Hidden caches, chests, and secrets are scattered across the world, often requiring sharp eyes or clever problem-solving to uncover. Some treasures lie in plain sight but demand the right tool, while others are buried deep within dangerous dungeons or behind riddles. The rewards range from valuable resources and rare crafting materials to unique artifacts that expand the lore of the land. Hunting for treasure not only breaks up the rhythm of farming and daily chores but also ties directly into progression, making exploration feel purposeful. Each find adds a spark of excitement, pushing you to search every corner of the map for what might lie just out of sight.</p>

        <p>Combat is where the stakes rise, challenging you to protect yourself and the town from hostile creatures. The system blends straightforward weapon skills with magical abilities, letting you adapt your approach depending on your strengths. Some enemies are weak and easily dispatched, while others require preparation — stronger weapons, better armor, or clever use of items. Fighting is not just about brute force; it often clears paths, protects townsfolk, and allows you to gather rare materials dropped by monsters. As you grow, combat becomes more strategic, rewarding those who learn enemy patterns and manage stamina or resources wisely. It ensures that adventure carries both risk and reward, adding a sense of urgency to your journey.</p>

        <h1>Fishing</h1>
            <img src="/Final_Project1/images/Fishing1.jpg" alt="fishing">
        <p>Fishing in <i>Fields of Mistria</i> is a slower, more meditative activity that balances out the intensity of combat and farming. With a simple rod, you can cast into rivers, lakes, or coastal waters, but your catches depend on location, season, and even the time of day. Some fish are common staples useful for cooking or selling, while others are rare and require patience or upgraded equipment to catch. The thrill comes from never knowing whether your next tug on the line will be something ordinary or extraordinary. Completing fish collections and seeking out legendary species adds long-term goals to this relaxing pastime. Fishing encourages you to pause, take in the atmosphere, and appreciate the quieter side of village life.</p>

        <h1>Relationship Building</h1>
            <img src="/Final_Project1/images/Romance.jpg" alt="relationship">
        <p>Relationships give <i>Fields of Mistria</i> its heart, turning the village from a backdrop into a living community. Every villager has their own story, personality, and daily routines, and taking the time to know them deepens your connection to the world. Through conversation, thoughtful gifts, and shared experiences, bonds grow stronger and new dialogue, quests, and storylines unfold. Some friendships blossom into romance, giving you the chance to build a life partner within the town. These relationships are more than optional side activities — they shape your experience, influence events, and create emotional investment in the town’s future. As you nurture these bonds, Mistria feels less like a place you’ve stumbled into and more like a home you’ve helped restore.</p>
