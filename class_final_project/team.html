            <h2><b>About NPC Studio</b></h2>
            <img src="images/NPCLogo.jpg" alt="NPClogo">
           <p>NPC Studio is an indie game development team based in Chicago, founded in 2019 with a vision to build games that resonate with the community. Although Fields of Mistria is their first major title, the core team is lean — around 15 people — supported at times by additional collaborators. Their lineup includes co-directors Claire Belton (Creative Director) and Andrew Duff (Lead Writer / Designer), Gabe as Lead Producer, Jonathan Spira heading programming, Hidehito Ikumo composing music, and artists, animators, writers, QA, and marketing personnel rounding out the roster. Driven by a deep love for the Farm-Sim RPG genre and classic anime visuals, NPC Studio embraces a philosophy of “making games we want to play,” blending nostalgic aesthetics with modern polish, quality-of-life features, and a tight bond with their player community.</p>

            <h2><b>The Leads</b></h2>
                <img src="images/dev2.jpg" alt="leadcreators">
        <p><b>Claire Belton</b> and <b>Andrew Duff</b> are the co-directors and creative leads behind Fields of Mistria. Long before this game, they were known for creating <b>Pusheen the Cat</b> through their webcomic brand Everyday Cute — a background rooted in character art, illustration, and storytelling.</p>
            <h3>Their Roles in <i>Fields of Misteria</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Claire Belton</b> acts as <b>Creative Director</b>, overseeing the visual identity, aesthetic consistency, character art, and guiding the artistic vision of the game.</li>
            <li><b>Andrew Duff</b> serves as <b>Lead Writer & Game Designer</b>, handling narrative direction, dialogue, story arcs, and core game systems in collaboration with Claire and the rest of the team.</li>
            <li>Together, they co-design the game, make high-level decisions, and ensure that gameplay, story, visuals, and mechanics cohere in harmony.</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>What Inspired Them to Create the Game</h3>
        <p><b>Claire Belton</b> and <b>Andrew Duff </b>drew inspiration from their love of classic farming and life-sim games such as <i><b>Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley,</b></i> and <i><b>Rune Factory</b></i>, as well as the vibrant charm of 90s anime like <i><b>Sailor Moon</b></i>. Coming from a background in character design and storytelling with their creation of Pusheen, they wanted to craft a game that combined cozy farming and exploration with expressive characters and heartfelt relationships. Their goal was simple: to make the kind of game they themselves had always wished to play, blending nostalgia with fresh ideas and community input to create a new but familiar world in <i>Fields of Mistria</i>.</p>

            <li><b>Hidehito Ikumo — Lead Composer</b>: Hidehito’s music sets the tone of the game, from peaceful mornings on the farm to adventurous journeys in caves, ensuring the world feels vibrant and alive.</li>
            <li><b>Catton Arthur — Composer & Sound Design</b>: Catton supports the soundtrack with additional compositions and creates the soundscapes that make everyday actions—like fishing or farming—immersive.</li>
